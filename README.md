# Pokemon-Project

This is my first project as a full stack web developer, i work on it during my studies at Henry bootcamp.

You can search pokemons, know more about them and even create your own poke!

Even though there are some aspects to improve im not going to modifie the code. It will be usefull for me to keep
track of my progress through all of my journey as a programmer!

Go with npm install and npm start commands!
